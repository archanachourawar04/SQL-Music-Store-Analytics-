# SQL-Music-Store-Analytics-
SQL analysis project on a music store database covering beginner to intermediate queries, joins, aggregations, and business-level insights such as revenue and top-selling tracks.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on practicing SQL queries using a Music Store Database.
The objective is to strengthen SQL fundamentals such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOINs, and business-level aggregations by solving real-world analytical questions.
The dataset represents a digital music store containing information about artists, albums, tracks, customers, employees, invoices, and sales transactions

## Database Tables Used
The project uses the following tables:
•	Artist – artist details
•	Album – albums released by artists
•	Track – individual music tracks
•	Genre – genre classification
•	Customer – customer information
•	Employee – store employees and support agents
•	Invoice – customer invoices (sales summary)
•	Invoice_Line – detailed sales transactions

## Skills & Concepts Covered
•	Basic SQL querying
•	Filtering data using WHERE
•	Sorting with ORDER BY
•	Aggregations using COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX
•	Grouping data with GROUP BY and HAVING
•	Multi-table joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
•	Revenue and sales analysis
•	Business-oriented problem solving

## Key Learnings
•	Sales and revenue are not stored directly but derived from invoice data
•	Correct table selection is critical for accurate analysis
•	Aggregation requires proper grouping
•	JOINs depend on logical relationships, not just column names
•	Business questions often require combining multiple tables

## Tools Used
•	SQL (PostgreSQL / SQLite compatible syntax)
•	Music Store / Chinook-style dataset
